# CIML-R: Causally Informed Machine Learning Based on Feature Relevance

This is a minimal example for the method and evaluation presented in the paper `CIML-R: Causally Informed Machine Learning Based on Feature Relevance`.

## Getting started
### Install dependencies
```
> apt install -y graphviz 
> conda create -n cimlr python=3.10 pip 
> conda activate cimlr
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start a `jupyter` notebook
```
> jupyter notebook
```

Then, you can use the notebook `cimlr-evaluation.ipynb` to run the experiment.
